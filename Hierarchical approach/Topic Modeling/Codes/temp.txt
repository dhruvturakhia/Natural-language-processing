nitroglycerine  and  unstable  front  with  pulsing

monolithic initial density 6.
Earlier  we  performed  study  and  revealed  that
different  profiles  of  particle  velocity  Ut  are
recorded at initiation of liquid HE according to the
scheme  presented  in  Fig.1.  Smoothly  decreasing
profiles see Fig.2- where value of the Neumann
spike was respectively equal to 21.6 GPa and 24.2
GPa  were  recorded  in  accordance  with  ZND
model at initiation of tetranitromethane TNM and
its  mixture  with  nitromethane  NM    TNMNM4654 2.
Two  types  of  Ut  profiles  were  recorded
at  initiation  of  mixture  composition  consisting  of
TNM  and  nitrobenzene  NB  TNMNB-7426.
When  changing  HE  thickness  from  2.4  mm  to  30 
mm  it  is  possible  to  record  accidentally  either  a
shock  wave  with  amplitude  of  17  GPa  or  a
opposite the jets the latter will effect on the front HE
layers i.e. the jets make an impact on unreacted HE.

We suppose that if the jet is decelerated in the
layer  of  high-density  HE  and  the  window  is
situated  just  behind  the  HE  layer  then  the  jet
influences HE and in the falling profile Ut at the
boundary  HE-window  we

20 ns. In our Ut recordings together with smooth
are  profiles  with  damping
oscillations.  In  cases  when  HE  has  high  porosity
and  cavities  size  is  large  the  jet  can  induce  very
large  perturbations  in  Ut  profile.  In  11
