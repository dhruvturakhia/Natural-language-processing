The most of ethylene oxide derivations have positive
HOFs values except I. The HOFs of isomers with the
same number of nitro groups are affected by the
positions of these groups and the values become
larger as the number of nitro groups is increased.
the calculated bond dissociation energies are
larger than 200 kJ mol-1 which indicate that all the
ethylene oxide derivations have good thermal stabilities. The values meet the request as high-density
compound BDE  120 kJ mol-1.
3 The calculated detonation velocity and detonation
pressure are very helpful for enhancing detonation
performance. The explosive performances of most of
ethylene oxide derivations would rang up with RDX.
It was found that oxygen balance play an important
role to detonation performance. Considering the
detonation performance and thermal stability II be
regarded as the potential candidates of HEDCs. These
results provide basic information for the molecular
design novel high-density materials.

Abstract A series of polynitroprismanes C6H6nNO2n
n016 intended for use as high energy density compounds
HEDCs were designed computationally. Their electronic
structures heats of formation interactions between nitro
groups specific enthalpies of combustion bond dissociation
energies and explosive performances detonation velocities
and detonation pressures were calculated using density
functional theory DFT with the 6-311 G basis set. The
results showed that all of the polynitroprismanes had high
positive heats of formation that increased with the number
of substitutions for the prismane derivatives while the specific enthalpy of combustion decreased as the number of
nitro groups increased. In addition the range of enthalpy of
combustion reducing is getting smaller. Interactions between ortho vicinal groups deviate from the group additivity rule and decrease as the number of nitro groups
increases. In terms of thermodynamic stability all of the
polynitroprismanes had higher bond dissociation energies
BDEs than RDX and HMX. Detonation velocities and
detonation pressures were estimated using modified KamletJacobs equations based on the heat of detonation Q and
the theoretical density of the molecule . It was found that
 D and P are strongly linearly related to the number of
nitro groups. Taking both their energetic properties and
thermal stabilities into account pentanitroprismane and hexanitroprismane are potential candidate HEDCs.

High energy density compounds HEDCs have been widely used for both military and civilian applications 14. In
the last few decades extensive theoretical studies have been
performed on pure nitrogen clusters because an all-nitrogen
molecule Nx can undergo the reaction Nxx2N2 which
1 or more per nitrogen atom
can exothermic by 50 kcal mol
making such clusters potential HEDCs 57. However
theoretical studies have shown that many Nx molecules are
not easily synthesized and are insufficiently stable to be
practical HEDCs 810. Besides these pure nitrogen clusters some other heterocyclic compounds have also attracted
considerable attention as possible HEDCs 1113. The
characteristic feature of such heterocyclic compounds is that
they release a great deal of energy upon the combustion of
their carbon backbones or the release of cage strain compared to traditional and modern energetic compounds. Besides the interest in this characteristic of heterocyclic
compounds other unique features of such molecules have
also attracted considerable attention such as high densities
and oxygen contents and good thermal stabilities 1418.
However when attempting to identify new HEDCs experimental synthesis is hazardous to humans and the environment. On the other hand computer simulation provides an
effective way to screen for promising explosives without
having to deal with such dangers so it has been used to
design various new energetic materials. Therefore when
searching for new HEDCs researchers generally perform
molecular design via computational methods and then use
the results of that modeling to synthesize new and improved
Among the various types of HEDCs organic cage compounds have attracted particular attention. CL-20 hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane 19 and polynitrocubane 20 are
J Mol Model 2012 1836953704
some well-known examples of cage compounds and the
successful synthesis of such compounds is generally
regarded as a breakthrough in the history of explosives.
Recently highly symmetrical polyhedral hydrocarbons have
attracted special interest from chemists because of their
highly strained structures 21. Lately polyisocyanoprismanes and polyazidoprismanes have been studied by Xu
Wen-Guo et al. 22 23. In addition azaprismanes were
studied by Politzer et al. in 1989 24 25. Their studies
show that these compounds could be used as high energy
Prismane itself has been synthesized and fully characterized while several substituted derivatives of this hydrocarbon have also been characterized see Fig. 1 for the structure
of prismane and its derivatives. Prismane is a hydrocarbon
with a large ring strain energy of 606.9 kJ mol
important requirement of HEDCs. Therefore we selected
the cage compound prismane D3h-C6H6 as the basis for
designing new high energy density compounds.
Nitro compounds an important class of HEDCs have also
long attracted attention from researchers due to their ability to
endure the high temperatures and low pressures encountered
in space 26. Hence in the present work the H atoms in
prismane were systematically replaced with nitro groups generating the series of molecules C6H6nNO2n n016. The
main difference between the nitro isocyano and azido functional groups is the amount of oxygen present. As far as
combustion is concerned the nitro group has an advantage.
In addition adding a nitro substituent can improve the detonation pressure detonation velocity and molecular density of
the compound more effectively than adding either isocyano
and azido groups. Thus in the work described in this paper
the molecular electronic geometries heats of formation interactions between nitro groups bond dissociation energies
specific enthalpies of combustion and detonation performances of these polynitroprismanes were studied in detail at the
B3LYP6-311 G level. Our results should provideuseful
information for the laboratory synthesis of polynitroprismanes
and the development of novel HEDCs.
Computational methods and details
The geometries of the polynitroprismanes were fully optimized without any symmetry restriction using density functional theory DFT at the B3LYP level with the 6-311 G
basis set in the Gaussian 03 software package 27. Harmonic vibrational and natural bond orbital NBO 28
analyses were then performed at the same level of theory
to confirm that the structures obtained corresponded to
minima and to determine the zero-point vibrational energy
The heats of formation HOFs of the compounds of
interest are needed to calculate their detonation energies.
In previous papers isodesmic reactions have been very
successfully employed to estimate the HOFs from the total
energies obtained from ab initio calculations 29 30.
Therefore in our work we also designed isodesmic reactions in which the basic structural unit of prismane was
retained but big molecules were changed into small ones
in order to obtain HOFs.
The isodesmic reactions used to calculate the HOFs of
the polynitroprismanes at 298 K were as follows
C6H6nNO2n  nCH4  C6H6  nCH3NO2nn  1  6
For each isodesmic reaction the HOF of the reaction
H298 at 298 K can be calculated using the following
Here Hfp and HfR are the heats of formation of the
reactants and products at 298 K respectively. The experimental HOFs of the reference compounds CH4 CH3NO2
and C6H6 are available which means that the HOFs of the
polynitroprismanes can be calculated when the heat of reaction H298 is known. H298 can be calculated using the
H298  E  ZPE  HT  nRT
Here E is the difference between the total energies of
the reactants and products at 0 K. ZPE is the difference
between the zero-point energies of the reactants and products. HT is the thermal correction from 0 to 298 K. nRT is
the work term which equals zero here.
Using the HOFs of the polynitroprismanes calculated
from Eqs. 2 and 3 it is a straightforward process to determine the enthalpy of combustion using Eq. 4
The enthalpies of formation of carbon dioxide and water
were also obtained from the NIST Chemistry Book website
these values are 393.52 and 285.83 kJ mol
Dividing the enthalpies of combustion obtained from Eq. 4 by
the respective molecular masses yields the specific enthalpies
To determine the strength of the interactions between the
nitro groups we computed the energy of disproportionation
of the isodesmic reaction
mC6H5NO2 ! m  1C6H6  C6H6mNO2m

using the bond dissociation energy BDE

The thermal stabilities of the compounds of interest
were evaluated by calculating the BDE of the trigger
bond. At 0 K the homolytic bond dissociation energy

can be obtained using Eq. 6
BDEA  B  EA  EB  EA  B
The zero-point energy ZPE corrected BDE can be cal
culated via Eq. 7
Here ZPE is the difference between the ZPE of the
products and that of the reactants.
The loading density 0 is an important parameter to
consider when HEDCs are designed. However 0 cannot
be obtained for compounds that have not been synthesized.
Therefore in previous studies 32 33 0 was replaced by
the theoretical density  because 0 is very close to .
Moreover an electrostatic interaction correction that improves
the accuracy of the predicted crystal density was also studied
by Politzer et al. 25 and their results showed that the
electrostatic interaction correction is useful for improving
the accuracy of the crystal density for some high energy
density compounds but not all of them. In our work we
needed molecular volume data to calculate the densities of
the polynitroprismanes. The molecular volume was defined as
the volume inside a contour of density 0.001 electronsbohr3
which was evaluated using Monte Carlo integration. This
method has frequently been applied to HEDCs in previous
For each compound of interest the explosive reaction was
identified by applying the most exothermic principle that is
all of the N atoms turn into N2 while the O atoms initially react
with H atoms to give H2O before forming CO2 with the C atom.
If the number of O atoms present in the molecule is greater than
the number needed to oxidize all of the H and C atoms the
redundant O atoms will combine to form O2. On the other
hand if the number of O atoms is insufficient to allow full
oxidation of the H and C atoms the remaining H atoms will be
incorporated into H2O while the remaining C atoms will exist
as solid-state C. Halogen atoms form hydrogen halides with
hydrogen atoms. Using the values of  and Q the heat of
detonation which is evaluated from the difference between
the HOFs of the products and the explosive via the principle
of exothermic reactions see Table 5 the fundamental detonation performance the detonation velocity and detonation pressure were obtained by the following KamletJacobs equations
D  101NM 12Q12121  130
Here D is the detonation velocity P is the detonation
pressure N is the moles of gaseous detonation products per

gram of explosive and M is the average molecular weight of
the gaseous products.
Results and discussion
Electronic structure and stability
Figure 1 shows the numbering scheme for the polynitroprismanes. The numbering system used was such that the nitro
groups were labeled with the smallest numbers possible that
were still consistent with the numbering pattern shown in
Fig. 1. There are a total of 11 structural isomers for these
polynitroprismanes. Table 1 lists the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital LUMO energies the energy gaps ELUMOHOMO
and the Wiberg bond indices for CNO2 bonds which were
obtained by NBO analyses of prismane and the polynitroprismanes at the B3LYP6-311 G level. From Table 1 it is clear
that the ELUMOHOMO values decrease as the number of nitro
groups increases. It is interesting to note that all of the polynitroprismanes have lower ELUMOHOMO values than the
unsubstituted prismane. Note that the ELUMOHOMO value
of the 12-bisnitroprismane is slightly smaller than that of its
isomer 15-bisnitroprismane. This shows that the 15-disnitroprismane is more stable than the 12-bisnitroprismane. It is
also worth noting that stability refers to the stability of the
compound to photoinitiated electron-transfer processes.
The fifth column in Table 1 shows the Wiberg bond indices
for CNO2 bonds. This is a theoretical index of the degree of
bonding between the two atoms. It can therefore be used as a

a 1- denotes 1-nitroprismane 12- denotes 12-isocyanoprismane and
measure of the overall strength of the bond between two
atoms on the whole the larger the Wiberg bond index the
stronger the bond. In previous studies 36 37 the CNO2
bond in a nitro derivative was found to have the smallest
Wiberg bond index in a of any of the bonds in that derivative.
Therefore we have only listed the CNO2 bond indices in
Table 1. In addition the energies of the CNO2 bonds were
calculated and are listed in this table. From Table 1 1nitroprismane has the highest bond order whereas
123456-hexanitroprismane has the lowest bond order as
the number of nitro groups in the molecule increases the
Wiberg bond index decreases and thus the stability of the
molecule decreases. Hence according to the principle of the
smallest bond order PSBO 38 hexanitroprismane has the
smallest bond order i.e. bond index of 0.8876 meaning that
it is very sensitive and relatively unstable to thermolysis. It is
clear that the energies of the CNO2 bonds decrease as the
bond index declines. This result also shows that the PSBO is a
reliable estimator of the bond dissociation energy.
Looking at the ELUMOHOMO and Wiberg bond index
values it is interesting to note that the PCN of 15-dinitroprismane is relatively low 0.9290 but that it has a high
ELUMOHOMO. On the other hand 14-dinitroprismane has
a high bond order of 0.9304 but a lower ELUMOHOMO
value than that of 15-dinitroprismane. This result shows
that the thermal stability of a polynitroprismane is not solely
related to its bond index or ELUMOHOMO value.

The HOF is the most practical parameter for experimentalists to use to determine the energetic properties of a chemical system. The higher the HOF the greater the energy
stored by the molecule. However obtaining HOFs of
HEDCs experimentally is an extremely ha
